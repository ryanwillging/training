\f0\fs24 \cf0 # 24-Week Performance Plan (VO\uc0\u8322  Max + Power/Mobility + 400y Freestyle)\
\
## Scope and Goals\
\
**Primary goals (try to achieve all):**\
- Maintain ~14% body fat (no macro plan included yet)\
- Increase VO\uc0\u8322  max (multi-modal: run/row/bike/swim)\
- Increase/maintain explosiveness + flexibility for:\
  - Snowboarding, golf, wakeboarding, chopping wood\
- Improve **400-yard freestyle time** in a **25-yard pool**, **from a push**\
  - **No start practice** (no dives, no reaction work)\
- Training time target: **3\'965 hours/week**\
  - Swim **2 days/week**\
  - Other workouts **2\'963 days/week**\
\
**Program length:** 24 weeks, periodized into 3 phases + taper/test.\
\
---\
\
## Testing Protocols (Baseline + Midpoint + Final)\
\
### Swim performance (25-yard pool; updated)\
All swim tests **from a push**. No start work.\
\
**Primary swim tests**\
1) **400y freestyle time trial (push)**\
   - Record:\
     - Total time\
     - 100 split times (0\'96100, 100\'96200, 200\'96300, 300\'96400) if possible\
     - RPE at finish\
     - Stroke count per 25 on:\
       - first 100 (pick 2 representative lengths)\
       - last 100 (pick 2 representative lengths)\
\
2) **CSS test (Critical Swim Speed, for training paces)**\
   - 400y TT + 200y TT in the same session, with full recovery (5\'9610 min easy between)\
   - CSS pace \uc0\u8776  (T400 \u8722  T200) / 2, expressed as pace per 100\
\
**Retest schedule**\
- **Week 1:** Baseline 400 TT on **Swim B day** (with taper) + CSS protocol\
- **Week 12:** Mid-cycle 400 TT on **Swim B day** (with taper) + CSS protocol\
- **Week 24:** Final 400 TT on **Swim B day** (with taper) + CSS protocol\
\
---\
\
## Weekly Structure (Default 5-day; scalable to 4-day)\
\
### Default weekly cadence (5 days)\
- **Day 1:** Swim A (Threshold/CSS development)\
- **Day 2:** Lift A (Lower strength + power + balance)\
- **Day 3:** VO\uc0\u8322  session (run/row/bike intervals)\
- **Day 4:** Swim B (VO\uc0\u8322  / 400-specific work **or 400 TT on test weeks**)\
- **Day 5:** Lift B (Upper strength + carries + trunk + rotational power)\
\
### If you want 4 days/week\
- Drop **Lift B**, or alternate Lift B every other week.\
\
---\
\
## Swimming Architecture (2 days/week) \'97 optimized for 400y (25-yard pool)\
\
### Non-negotiables (constraints honored)\
- All work is from a **push**.\
- **No start practice** (no dives, no reaction work).\
- Turns/push-offs/streamline discipline remain part of 400 execution.\
\
### Swim training intent by session type\
- **Swim A:** Raise sustainable pace and economy (threshold/CSS focus).\
- **Swim B:** Raise aerobic power and 400-specific tolerance (VO\uc0\u8322  sets, broken 400s, pacing discipline), and hosts the **400 TT** on test weeks.\
\
---\
\
## Swim A \'97 Threshold / CSS Development (25y pool)\
\
**Warm-up (10\'9612 min)**\
- 300 easy\
- 6\'d750 drill/swim by 25 (15\'9620s rest)\
  - Example drills: catch-up, fingertip drag, 6-kick switch, scull (as available)\
\
**Main sets by phase**\
- **Weeks 1\'962:** 10\'d7100 @ steady (RPE 6\'967), 15\'9620s rest  \
- **Weeks 3\'964:** 8\'d7125 @ steady, 15\'9620s rest  \
- **Weeks 5\'966:** 6\'d7150 @ steady, 20\'9625s rest  \
- **Weeks 7\'968:** 5\'d7200 @ steady, 20\'9630s rest  \
\
- **Weeks 9\'9610:** 12\'d7100 @ CSS pace, 10\'9615s rest  \
- **Weeks 11\'9612:** 8\'d7150 @ CSS pace, 15\'9620s rest  \
- **Weeks 13\'9614:** 6\'d7200 @ CSS pace, 20s rest  \
- **Weeks 15\'9616:** 4\'d7300 @ slightly slower than CSS, 30s rest  \
\
- **Weeks 17\'9618:** 3\'d7(4\'d7100 @ target 400 pace), 15\'9620s rest; 2 min between rounds  \
- **Weeks 19\'9620:** 6\'d7150 @ target 400 pace, 20\'9630s rest  \
- **Weeks 21\'9622:** 3\'d7300 @ target 400 pace, 30\'9645s rest  \
- **Week 23:** 6\'d750 @ target 400 pace, generous rest  \
- **Week 24:** light technique (see taper section) + 400 TT on Swim B day\
\
**Cool-down**\
- 200 easy\
\
**Notes**\
- Track average pace across the main set and watch for late-set form breakdown.\
- Track stroke count drift (first vs last part of main set).\
- If form collapses: reduce intensity first, then reduce volume.\

## Swim B \'97 VO\uc0\u8322  + 400-Specific Work (25y pool) + 400 TT on test weeks\
\
### Standard Swim B (non-test weeks)\
\

\
## 400 TT Execution (Swim B Day) \'97 Week 1, Week 12, Week 24\
\
### Test-week taper rules (swim-specific)\
You will taper into the 400 TT with two constraints:\
1) Maintain sharpness (a few short fast efforts)\
2) Reduce fatigue (meaningful volume reduction)\
\
#### Day -3 to Day -2 (48\'9672 hours before TT)\
- No maximal lower-body lifting\
- No VO\uc0\u8322  land intervals (run/row/bike) within 48\'9672 hours if possible\
- Swim A earlier that week becomes **reduced volume** (see below)\
\
#### Day -1 (24 hours before TT)\
- Optional: 15\'9625 min easy swim with 4\'d725 \'93fast-but-clean\'94 and full rest  \
- If you\'92re fatigued, skip the swim entirely and just do mobility\
\
### Swim A adjustment during test weeks (Weeks 1, 12, 24)\
On the Swim A day earlier that week:\
- Keep warm-up the same\
- Main set becomes:\
  - **6\'d750 @ CSS/target 400 pace**, 30\'9645s rest (crisp)\
- Cool-down 200 easy\
\
### Swim B test-day session template (25y pool; push start)\
\
**Warm-up (12\'9618 min)**\
- 300 easy\
- 4\'d750 build (easy \uc0\u8594  moderate), 20s rest\
- 4\'d725 fast-but-clean, 40\'9660s rest\
- 2\'d725 easy\
- Rest 2\'963 minutes before the TT\
\
**Test**\
- **400y freestyle TT (push)**\
\
**Post-test**\
- 200\'96400 easy cool-down\
- Optional: 4\'d750 very easy drill/swim if you feel tight\
\
### Pacing guidance for the 400 TT (no starts)\
- Goal: **controlled first 100**, build through 200\'96300, hold form 300\'96400.\
- If you have splits, aim for:\
  - 0\'96100: controlled-hard\
  - 100\'96200: match or slightly faster\
  - 200\'96300: highest sustainable effort\
  - 300\'96400: \'93hold technique under pain\'94 (do not let stroke fall apart)\
\
---\
\
## Swim Skill Priorities (400-specific, no starts)\
\
Highest ROI technical focuses:\
- Stroke length + stroke rate control (avoid \'93spinning out\'94 early)\
- Breathing strategy that doesn\'92t spike HR early (adjust as needed)\
- Turns: consistent speed into wall, tight rotation, strong push, streamline discipline\
- Underwater discipline off walls (not max distance; just consistent and clean)\
