# 6-Week Swim Block (2x/week)

**Goal:** improve aerobic base + threshold + VO2/speed; retest at Week 6.

## Workouts

| Week | Swim 1 | Swim 2 |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | W1S1 CSS Test | W1S2 Aerobic + Technique |
| 2 | W2S1 Speed + Balance | W2S2 Threshold 100s |
| 3 | W3S1 Endurance 400s | W3S2 VO2 50s |
| 4 | W4S1 Pull Strength | W4S2 Ladder + Sprints |
| 5 | W5S1 Speed Endurance 75s | W5S2 Broken 500 |
| 6 | W6S1 CSS Retest | W6S2 Simulation |

## Pacing guidance

- **Aerobic:** comfortable, nose-breathable when possible, focus on long strokes and body line.
- **Threshold (CSS):** “hard sustainable”; minimal pace fade across repeats.
- **VO2 / sprints:** prioritize quality; if splits degrade materially, add rest or reduce reps.

## Notes for the watch

These are structured as **pool swim workouts** with step repeats and rest steps. Ensure your watch pool size is set to **25 yards** for the `25y` files.
