# Athletic Performance Block (6 Weeks)

This plan keeps your consistent lifts, adds swim speed/threshold work, and includes one VO₂ interval day.

## Baseline + retest (Weeks 1 & 6)

**Power/balance**
- Standing broad jump: 3 attempts, record best.
- Single-leg balance: 60s each leg, record fail time.

**Strength**
- Back squat: 5RM @ RPE ~8 (stop with 2 reps in reserve).
- Deadlift: 3RM @ RPE ~8.
- Pull-ups: strict max reps.

**VO₂ proxy** (choose one)
- Run: 20-min hard TT (record avg pace + HR).
- Rower: 2,000m TT (record time + HR).

**Swim**
- Swim A: 4×100 with full rest (record best + average).
- Swim B: 500 continuous (record time).

## Weekly cadence (default 5 days)

| Day | Session |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Swim A — Speed + Skill |
| 2 | Lift A — Lower Strength + Power + Balance |
| 3 | VO₂ Intervals (run/erg) |
| 4 | Swim B — Threshold + Aerobic |
| 5 (optional) | Lift B — Upper Strength + Carry |

If you only want **4 days**, skip Day 5 and rotate key Lift B movements into Lift A.

# Swim A — Speed + Skill

**Goal:** faster 25/50/100 speed with technical control.

**Warm-up**

**Main set**
- 8×25 fast (RPE 9) — 20–30s rest
- 6×50 strong (RPE 8) — 30–40s rest

**Finish**
- 4×25 easy-perfect form
- 100 easy cooldown

**Progression**
- **W1:** 6×25 + 4×50
- **W2:** 8×25 + 5×50
- **W3:** 10×25 + 6×50
- **W4:** 6×25 + 4×50 (deload-ish)
- **W5:** 12×25 + 6×50 (or reduce rest by 5–10s)
- **W6:** Swim test week (4×100 with full rest)

# Lift A — Lower Strength + Power + Balance

**Warm-up (8–10 min)**
- Air Bike or Row: 5 min easy
- Lateral band walks: 2×12/side
- Hip mobility: 3–5 min
- 2–3 warm-up sets for first lift

**Block 1 — Power**
1. Box jump (or broad jump) — 5×3
2. Kettlebell swing — 4×8

**Block 2 — Strength**
3. Back squat — see progression below

**Block 3 — Posterior chain**
4. RDL (barbell) — 3–4×6–8

**Block 4 — Unilateral / balance**
5. Bulgarian split squat — 3×8/side

**Block 5 — Trunk**
6. Pallof press — 3×10/side
7. Farmer carry — 4×30–45s

**Squat progression (Weeks 1–6)**
- **W1 (baseline):** top set of 5 @ RPE 8, then 2×5 @ -10%
- **W2:** 4×5 @ RPE 7–8
- **W3:** 5×4 @ RPE 8
- **W4:** 3×5 @ RPE 6–7
- **W5:** 6×3 @ RPE 8 (move fast)
- **W6 (retest):** 5RM @ RPE 8 again

**RDL + Bulgarian progression**
- Add **5 lb/week** if reps are clean and last set is ≤RPE 8.
- If form degrades, hold load and add 1 rep per set until top of range.

# VO₂ Day — Intervals

**Goal:** raise VO₂ max without interfering with strength/swim.

**Running VO₂ intervals (preferred)**
- Warm-up: 10–12 min easy + 4×20s strides
- **W1:** 5×2:00 hard / 2:00 easy
- **W2:** 6×2:00 hard / 2:00 easy
- **W3:** 5×3:00 hard / 2:00 easy
- **W4:** 4×2:00 hard / 2:00 easy (deload)
- **W5:** 4×4:00 hard / 2:00 easy
- **W6:** 20-min TT
- Cool-down: 8–10 min easy

**Intensity cue:** heavy breathing; 1–2 words max; pace stays consistent.

Row/SkiErg or Air Bike can replace running using the same work/rest pattern.

# Swim B — Threshold + Aerobic Base

**Goal:** sustainable pace, better 500 time, better repeatability.

**Warm-up**
- 300 easy
- 4×50 drill/build (last 15m strong)

**Main**
- **W1:** 10×100 @ steady hard (RPE 7–8), 20–30s rest

- **W3:** 8×150 steady hard, 25–35s rest
- **W4:** 8×100 (sharp, not crushing)
- **W5:** 6×200 steady hard, 30–40s rest

**Progression**
- Weeks 1–3: add reps within range, then add 2.5–5 lb
- Week 4: reduce sets by ~30%
- Weeks 5–6: heavier sets (lower rep end), keep form tight
