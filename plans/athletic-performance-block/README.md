# Athletic Performance Block (6 Weeks)

This block blends swim speed/threshold work, lower-body strength/power, unilateral balance, and VO₂ intervals.

## Weekly cadence (default 5 days)

| Day | Session |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Swim A — Speed + Skill |
| 2 | Lift A — Lower Strength + Power + Balance |
| 3 | VO₂ Intervals (run/erg) |
| 4 | Swim B — Threshold + Aerobic |
| 5 (optional) | Lift B — Upper Strength + Carry |

If you only want **4 days**, skip Day 5 and rotate key Lift B movements into Lift A.

## Baseline + retest

- **Week 1:** Baseline (stop 1–2 reps shy of failure).
- **Week 6:** Retest using the same protocols.

See `plan.md` for workout details and progression.
