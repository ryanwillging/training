# 24-Week Performance Plan (VO₂ Max + Power/Mobility + 400y Freestyle)

## Scope and Goals

**Primary goals (try to achieve all):**
- Maintain ~14% body fat (no macro plan included yet)
- Increase VO₂ max (multi-modal: run/row/bike/swim)
- Increase/maintain explosiveness + flexibility for:
  - Snowboarding, golf, wakeboarding, chopping wood
- Improve **400-yard freestyle time** in a **25-yard pool**, **from a push**
  - **No start practice** (no dives, no reaction work)
- Training time target: **3–5 hours/week**
  - Swim **2 days/week**
  - Other workouts **2–3 days/week**

**Program length:** 24 weeks, periodized into 3 phases + taper/test.

---

## Testing Protocols (Baseline + Midpoint + Final)

### Swim performance (25-yard pool)
All swim tests **from a push**. No start work.

**Primary swim tests**
1) **400y freestyle time trial (push)**
   - Record:
     - Total time
     - 100 split times (0–100, 100–200, 200–300, 300–400) if possible
     - RPE at finish
     - Stroke count per 25 on:
       - first 100 (pick 2 representative lengths)
       - last 100 (pick 2 representative lengths)

2) **CSS test (Critical Swim Speed, for training paces)**
   - 400y TT + 200y TT in the same session, with full recovery (5–10 min easy between)
   - CSS pace ≈ (T400 − T200) / 2, expressed as pace per 100

**Retest schedule**
- **Week 1:** Baseline 400 TT on **Swim B day** (with taper) + CSS protocol
- **Week 12:** Mid-cycle 400 TT on **Swim B day** (with taper) + CSS protocol
- **Week 24:** Final 400 TT on **Swim B day** (with taper) + CSS protocol

---

## Weekly Structure (Default 5-day; scalable to 4-day)

### Default weekly cadence (5 days)
- **Day 1:** Swim A (Threshold/CSS development)
- **Day 2:** Lift A (Lower strength + power + balance)
- **Day 3:** VO₂ session (run/row/bike intervals)
- **Day 4:** Swim B (VO₂ / 400-specific work **or 400 TT on test weeks**)
- **Day 5:** Lift B (Upper strength + carries + trunk + rotational power)

### If you want 4 days/week
- Drop **Lift B**, or alternate Lift B every other week.

---

## Swimming Architecture (2 days/week) — optimized for 400y (25-yard pool)

### Non-negotiables (constraints honored)
- All work is from a **push**.
- **No start practice** (no dives, no reaction work).
- Turns/push-offs/streamline discipline remain part of 400 execution.

### Swim training intent by session type
- **Swim A:** Raise sustainable pace and economy (threshold/CSS focus).
- **Swim B:** Raise aerobic power and 400-specific tolerance (VO₂ sets, broken 400s, pacing discipline), and hosts the **400 TT** on test weeks.

---

## Swim A — Threshold / CSS Development (25y pool)

**Warm-up (10–12 min)**
- 300 easy
- 6×50 drill/swim by 25 (15–20s rest)
  - Example drills: catch-up, fingertip drag, 6-kick switch, scull (as available)

**Main sets by phase**
- **Weeks 1–2:** 10×100 @ steady (RPE 6–7), 15–20s rest
- **Weeks 3–4:** 8×125 @ steady, 15–20s rest
- **Weeks 5–6:** 6×150 @ steady, 20–25s rest
- **Weeks 7–8:** 5×200 @ steady, 20–30s rest

- **Weeks 9–10:** 12×100 @ CSS pace, 10–15s rest
- **Weeks 11–12:** 8×150 @ CSS pace, 15–20s rest
- **Weeks 13–14:** 6×200 @ CSS pace, 20s rest
- **Weeks 15–16:** 4×300 @ slightly slower than CSS, 30s rest

- **Weeks 17–18:** 3×(4×100 @ target 400 pace), 15–20s rest; 2 min between rounds
- **Weeks 19–20:** 6×150 @ target 400 pace, 20–30s rest
- **Weeks 21–22:** 3×300 @ target 400 pace, 30–45s rest
- **Week 23:** 6×50 @ target 400 pace, generous rest
- **Week 24:** light technique (see taper section) + 400 TT on Swim B day

**Cool-down**
- 200 easy

**Notes**
- Track average pace across the main set and watch for late-set form breakdown.
- Track stroke count drift (first vs last part of main set).
- If form collapses: reduce intensity first, then reduce volume.

## 400 TT Execution (Swim B Day) — Week 1, Week 12, Week 24

### Test-week taper rules (swim-specific)
You will taper into the 400 TT with two constraints:
1) Maintain sharpness (a few short fast efforts)
2) Reduce fatigue (meaningful volume reduction)

#### Day -3 to Day -2 (48–72 hours before TT)
- No maximal lower-body lifting
- No VO₂ land intervals (run/row/bike) within 48–72 hours if possible
- Swim A earlier that week becomes **reduced volume** (see below)

#### Day -1 (24 hours before TT)
- Optional: 15–25 min easy swim with 4×25 "fast-but-clean" and full rest
- If you're fatigued, skip the swim entirely and just do mobility

### Swim A adjustment during test weeks (Weeks 1, 12, 24)
On the Swim A day earlier that week:
- Keep warm-up the same
- Main set becomes:
  - **6×50 @ CSS/target 400 pace**, 30–45s rest (crisp)
- Cool-down 200 easy

### Swim B test-day session template (25y pool; push start)

**Warm-up (12–18 min)**
- 300 easy
- 4×50 build (easy → moderate), 20s rest
- 4×25 fast-but-clean, 40–60s rest
- 2×25 easy
- Rest 2–3 minutes before the TT

**Test**
- **400y freestyle TT (push)**

**Post-test**
- 200–400 easy cool-down
- Optional: 4×50 very easy drill/swim if you feel tight

### Pacing guidance for the 400 TT (no starts)
- Goal: **controlled first 100**, build through 200–300, hold form 300–400.
- If you have splits, aim for:
  - 0–100: controlled-hard
  - 100–200: match or slightly faster
  - 200–300: highest sustainable effort
  - 300–400: "hold technique under pain" (do not let stroke fall apart)

---

## Swim Skill Priorities (400-specific, no starts)

Highest ROI technical focuses:
- Stroke length + stroke rate control (avoid "spinning out" early)
- Breathing strategy that doesn't spike HR early (adjust as needed)
- Turns: consistent speed into wall, tight rotation, strong push, streamline discipline
- Underwater discipline off walls (not max distance; just consistent and clean)

---

## Implementation Note

This plan will be:
1. Parsed programmatically to generate scheduled workouts
2. Converted to Garmin FIT files with specific dates
3. Uploaded to Garmin Connect calendar
4. Evaluated nightly after data sync to assess progress
5. Adjusted using AI analysis when needed
