  - Set 1: 1:10 (70 seconds)
  - Set 2: 1:00 (60 seconds)

- **Pull-ups**:
  - Set 1: 10 reps
  - Set 2: 8 reps
  - Set 3: 7 reps

### Body Composition
- **Method**: InBody scale (https://inbodyusa.com/)
- **Current Body Fat %**: TBD (needs measurement)
- **Current Weight**: TBD

### VO2 Max
- **Current**: TBD (pull from Garmin Connect)
- **Target**: 55+ ml/kg/min

## Equipment

### Garmin
- **Device**: Forerunner 965
- **Features**: Full FIT workout support, VO2 max tracking, swim metrics

### Body Composition
- **Scale**: InBody
- **Data Entry**: Manual (API integration future consideration)

### Strength Training
- **App**: Hevy (Hevy Pro)
- **API Key**: Configured in .env
- **Features**: Workout tracking, exercise library, routine management

## Goals

1. **Body Fat**: Maintain 14%
2. **VO2 Max**: Increase (target 55+)
3. **Explosive/Flexible**: Improve broad jump, maintain strength for snowboarding, golf, wakeboarding, wood chopping
4. **100yd Freestyle**: Improve time (target TBD after baseline test)
5. **Weekly Volume**: 3-5 hours at convenient times

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Document baseline metrics
2. [ ] Run CSS baseline swim test (from 6-week-block plan)
3. [ ] Measure current body fat % on InBody scale
4. [ ] Pull current VO2 max from Garmin Connect
5. [ ] Establish 100yd freestyle baseline time
6. [ ] Begin tracking in database once system is built

## Notes

- Broad jump of 102" is excellent (elite level for most athletes)
- Dead hang times show good grip strength and shoulder stability
- Pull-up performance shows solid upper body strength endurance
- Need to establish swim and body composition baselines to track progress
